# Encylopaedia Metallum - Metal Archives Desktop App

After the drive to learn threading and better JavaFX (e.g. FXML, ect.) this is the deformed bastard love child of that learning. As per my usual JavaFX programs, I was stoned while writing half of it, most of the code is probably a bastardized deformation of sanity and if it actually works, I'll be waiting for my nobel peace prize in the mail.
